## Challenge 

The challenge you are given is to drain the voting lockup contract of all of its tokens by exploiting a vulnerability.

The challenge contracts are located in the `/src` folder of this repository. 
Your solution to the challenge should be filled in in `test/Solve.sol`. 
Everything should be ready to run if you follow the steps:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install Forge: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation
3. Make sure your terminal is in the folder (e.g. `cd remedy-invitational-challenge`).
4. Run the project: `forge test`
5. The test will fail, as you have not solved the challenge yet.
6. Analyze the challenge contracts, create your exploit in the test file and solve the challenge!
